# Gaze_Following_Tobii_Eyetracker
This repository contains code and analysis for a project examining implicit and explicit gaze-following behavior in nonhuman primates using a Tobii eye tracker. The goal is to investigate how primates process and respond to social gaze cues, comparing automatic (implicit) attentional shifts with deliberate (explicit) gaze-following responses.

Task operates on Tobii TX300
